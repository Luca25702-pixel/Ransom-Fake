# Ransom-Fake

This repository contains an open-source simulation of a ransomware-like "virus" designed to move your libraries to `%UserProfile%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows` and replace them with "encrypted" files. This project is intended for educational purposes only.

## How to Make It Work

To ensure the functionality of this simulation, please note the following requirements:

- **Run as Administrator**: The script must be executed **without** administrative privileges.
- **PowerShell Execution Policy**: Your PowerShell execution policy should allow the execution of scripts. Ensure it is not restricted to only trusted scripts.
- **Ransomware Protection**: Disable any ransomware protection features in the Windows Security app, as they may prevent the script from functioning.

## Disclaimer

This project is strictly for educational purposes. **Do not use it for pranks or illegal activities.** Engaging in illegal activities can be classified as cybercrime and may have serious legal consequences.

**Be Aware!** Using this simulation for malicious purposes is unethical and can lead to severe repercussions.
